This is my Online Class Attendance Record Form Website created for users to submit an attendance using an online method by integrating Github.io, Google Form and Google Spreadsheet.

In this website, there is no database usage. Only a static website using Bootstrap layout embedded with Google Form and Google Spreadsheet. The students need to fill-in their necessary information after chosen their class name by clicking at the Class menu. The students can view the information in the Record Result menu. 

To compile and use this system. Please follow steps as below:

Install xampp in your Window or Linux. Or install Laragon in your Window. Put this project into your working directory folder. If you want to use this project for your own, please make sure to change the Google Form links and also the Google Spreadsheet links.

That's all. Happy learning! Feel free to view the website at https://ehadir-fhba.github.io
